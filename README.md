# 🌐 Profile Website

The “nabo_hackclub” repository is a small and simple frontend profile website. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a profile page. It uses a profile photo and other images, which are located in the /img folder. It probably contains information about a name, contact information, or skills, and some interactivity is provided using a script.js file.
